## Problem Statement
Elections, referenda, and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy. Build a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate how you can make these processes more secure, reliable, and transparent using Azure Blockchain.

## Our Solution
The vast majority of elections, as of now, are conducted by a central authority that yields a disproportionate amount of power. We aim to make the process of elections more transparent, beyond the control of a central authority, and verifiable by any voter. Along with that, we aim to boost voter turnout by developing an **online voting system** that frees the voter from the constraint of being present at a particular location to vote.

Given a list of registered voters, the process of voting will be conducted via smart contracts. The smart contract will entitle a voter to a single vote, only. The votes will be stored on a blockchain, thus making them tamper-proof. Finally, the votes will be counted, giving the results of the election.
